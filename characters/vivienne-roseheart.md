# Madam Vivienne Roseheart - High-End Magical Fashion Designer

> *"Darling, fashion isn't simply about what one wears - it's about weaving magic into every thread, every seam, every shimmering detail that transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary."*

## Background

Madam Vivienne Roseheart is wizarding Britain's premier magical fashion designer, creating enchanted garments that blend beauty with magical functionality. Her Diagon Alley boutique, "Threads of Enchantment," serves Ministry officials and wealthy families with robes that adapt to weather, change colors with mood, and provide subtle protective charms.

A former Gryffindor who excelled in Charms and Transfiguration, Vivienne built her reputation through bold designs and fearless business partnerships. Five years ago, she partnered exclusively with Minerva Goldstein - her supply chain provides rare magical materials while Vivienne designs her company uniforms and introduces her to wealthy social circles.

However, Vivienne's controlling nature has strained their partnership. She demands advance notice of all her business decisions, fearing independent ventures might compromise their exclusive arrangements. Last week, when Minerva missed a crucial supplier meeting that could have secured phoenix feather access, she suspected Minerva was conducting secret business behind her back.

Her longtime friendship with Lady Cordelia Blackthorne has proven invaluable, as Cordelia showcases Vivienne's designs at high-society events, serving as an unofficial ambassador to the wizarding elite.

## Current Concerns

Augustus Thornwick's corruption investigations have created uncertainty that could affect her wealthy clientele and established business relationships.

## Gala Objectives

**1. Confront Minerva About Missing Business Meeting**
Directly address why Minerva missed last week's crucial supplier meeting that could have secured exclusive phoenix feather access. Vivienne suspects she might be starting business ventures behind her back and needs to understand whether their partnership agreement is still being honored. She's prepared to demand greater transparency about her activities, as their business success depends on mutual trust and coordination.

**2. Strengthen Connections with Wealthy Clientele**
Use the gala to cultivate relationships with potential new high-end customers and reinforce bonds with existing ones. Priority targets include Minister Octavius Goldenheart, Lady Alice Ashworth, and Auror Commander Lysander Stone (uniforms). With Augustus's investigations creating uncertainty in wizarding society, Vivienne needs to ensure her client base remains stable and continues to value the luxury and status her enchanted garments provide.
