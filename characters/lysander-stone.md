# Auror Commander Lysander Stone

> *"In my experience, the most dangerous criminals are often hiding in plain sight at the Ministry's finest gatherings."*

## Background

Auror Commander Lysander Stone has dedicated his life to upholding magical law and order, rising through the ranks of the Auror Office through sheer determination and an uncanny ability to see patterns others miss. As the youngest person ever appointed to lead the Auror Office, Lysander carries himself with the quiet confidence of someone who has faced down Dark wizards and lived to tell the tale.

Recently, Lysander has been investigating a series of peculiar break-ins at various Ministry-connected locations. What started as simple burglary cases has begun revealing a disturbing pattern - someone has been systematically accessing financial records and correspondence related to magical creature welfare funding. The thefts have been so carefully executed that most victims didn't even realize anything was missing until Lysander's team conducted thorough magical trace examinations.

Tonight's gala represents more than just a social obligation for Lysander. With so many Ministry officials and prominent wizarding citizens gathered in one place, he sees it as an opportunity to observe interactions and perhaps catch a glimpse of the criminal mind behind these sophisticated break-ins.

## Gala Objectives

**1. Investigate Break-In Connections**
Speak with various Ministry officials and prominent citizens to subtly gather information about the recent break-ins. Try to determine if anyone has noticed missing documents, unusual inquiries about their records, or suspicious activity around their properties.

**2. Assess Security Vulnerabilities**
Since Captain Magnus Thornfield is providing security for tonight's event, use this opportunity to discuss potential weaknesses in Ministry security protocols and learn about his security consulting methods.
