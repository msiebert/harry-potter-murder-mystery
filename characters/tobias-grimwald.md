# Tobias Grimwald - Magical Creature Reserve Owner

> *"Every magical creature deserves respect and proper care, though I must admit some are considerably more profitable than others when it comes to keeping the lights on."*

## Background

Tobias Grimwald owns Moonhaven Creature Reserve in the Scottish Highlands, providing sanctuary for injured and endangered magical beings. A former Slytherin who studied under Professor Aldric Spellsworth, Tobias was one of only four students trusted with the dangerous Arresto Incantum spell - a charm that delays the next spell cast by exactly fifteen minutes. His reserve houses rescued Hippogriffs, an elderly dragon, and other creatures through innovative rehabilitation programs.

Running the reserve requires enormous funding - Hippogriff feed costs 500 Galleons monthly, and healing potions often exceed 1,000 Galleons per case. Tobias depends heavily on Ministry permits for exhibitions and breeding programs, permits now under intense scrutiny from Augustus Thornwick's investigations.

Financial pressure has led him to occasional visits to Griffin's Gambit Hippogriff Racing, where he studies racing breeds while hoping for modest wins. During one visit, he witnessed Cornelius Pemberton suffer devastating losses - watching the Ministry treasurer drop over 1,500 Galleons on three consecutive races was deeply concerning. The man looked absolutely ill walking away.

Augustus's investigation has resulted in surprise inspections of Tobias's permits and breeding records. While Moonhaven operates within magical law, the scrutiny has delayed permit renewals and made donors nervous about supporting any organization under Ministry investigation.

## Gala Objectives

**1. Secure Support from Minister Goldenheart**
Approach the Minister directly to clarify that Moonhaven Reserve operates with complete transparency and request assurance that his facility won't be unfairly targeted in Augustus's anti-corruption campaign. Tobias needs to emphasize how vital his conservation work is for magical creature welfare and how damaging false accusations could be for endangered species protection.

**2. Negotiate Bulk Pricing with Barnabas Goldstein**
Connect with the Diagon Alley supply chain owner about securing cheaper rates for healing potions and medical supplies. With costs exceeding 1,000 Galleons per serious case and the reserve's budget stretched thin, Tobias desperately needs to find more affordable sources for the specialized ingredients required to treat injured magical creatures.
