# Sebastian Ravencrest - Wealthy Businessman

> *"Success in business, my dear fellow, is rather like brewing a perfect potion - it requires the finest ingredients, precise timing, and just a touch of magic that separates the extraordinary from the merely adequate."*

## Background

Sebastian Ravencrest has built his fortune through a collection of upscale establishments throughout magical Britain. His business empire includes The Golden Goblet, an exclusive members-only club in Diagon Alley, Ravencrest Rare Antiquities, and several high-end event venues. What sets Sebastian apart is his meticulous attention to discretion - his establishments provide luxury services with absolute confidentiality for Ministry officials and prominent families.

A former Slytherin who excelled in Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts, Sebastian was among the select few students trusted by Professor Spellsworth with the dangerous Arresto Incantum spell. His relationship with younger sister Ophelia is protective - while she runs a specialized school for young witches and wizards with special magical needs, he ensures their family's financial security and social standing.

Recently, Augustus Thornwick's investigations have subjected several of Sebastian's establishments to surprise inspections and permit scrutiny. While Sebastian operates within wizarding law, he recognizes that Thornwick's reformist zeal could turn public opinion against the exclusive services that form his business foundation.

## Gala Objectives

**1. Assess Regulatory Climate**
Engage with Ministry officials, particularly Minister Goldenheart and other senior staff, to understand how the current political climate might affect exclusive businesses like his own. Sebastian needs to gauge whether the Ministry's recent push for "transparency" will result in more stringent regulations on private clubs and luxury establishments.

**2. Explore New Investment Partnerships**
Connect with other successful business owners at the gala to discuss potential joint ventures or investment opportunities. Sebastian is particularly interested in connecting with Lord Reginald Ashworth, Barnabas Goldstein, Madam Vivienne Roseheart, and Tobias Grimwald to explore mutually beneficial business relationships.
