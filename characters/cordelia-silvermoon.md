# Cordelia Silvermoon - Magical Portrait Artist

> *"A truly magnificent portrait captures not just one's appearance, my dear, but the very essence of their magical soul - though I must say, some souls are considerably more... complex than others."*

## Background

Cordelia Silvermoon has established herself as wizarding Britain's most sought-after magical portrait artist, serving as the Ministry of Magic's official chronicler for the past fifteen years. Her enchanted portraits grace the walls of the Minister's office, department heads' studies, and the homes of prominent wizarding families throughout the country. What sets Cordelia's work apart is her unique ability to capture not just physical likenesses, but the magical aura and personality essence of her subjects - her portraits are renowned for their lifelike conversations and uncanny ability to offer advice that reflects their original's character.

A former Ravenclaw who excelled in Ancient Runes and Charms, Cordelia discovered her artistic calling during her sixth year when she created a moving portrait of her late grandmother that could actually dispense the elderly witch's favorite knitting advice. Professor Aldric Spellsworth, recognizing her exceptional talent and unwavering moral character, selected her as one of only five students to learn his dangerous Arresto Incantum spell - a fifteen-minute delay charm that he entrusted only to those he deemed completely trustworthy.

Cordelia's studio in Diagon Alley, "Silvermoon Portraits & Magical Memories," has become a gathering place for the wizarding elite. Her commission waiting list extends over two years, with families booking portrait sessions for significant life events - ministry promotions, wedding announcements, and memorial pieces for departed loved ones. Her most recent high-profile commission was Augustus Thornwick's official Deputy Minister portrait, completed just six months ago when he received his promotion.

Her artistic process involves extensive conversations with her subjects, allowing her to understand their personalities, motivations, and deepest concerns before beginning the magical painting process. This intimate approach has made her privy to countless secrets and personal struggles among the Ministry's leadership, though her professional discretion has never been questioned.

## Gala Objectives

**1. Gather Inspiration for Her Secret Portrait Collection**
Cordelia maintains a private collection of "character study" portraits - unofficial paintings that capture people's hidden personalities and secret struggles, which she creates purely for artistic exploration. Tonight's gala provides perfect opportunity to observe the complex relationships and concealed tensions among the wizarding elite, giving her material for new character studies. She's particularly intrigued by the dynamics between Ministry officials and wealthy donors, wondering what fascinating contradictions she might discover beneath their public facades.

**2. Explore Artistic Collaboration with St. Mungo's**
Connect with Madam Isadora Nightingale about creating a series of commemorative portraits for the new Spell Damage ward - perhaps depicting the healers' breakthrough treatments or honoring patients who've made remarkable recoveries. This partnership could open up an entirely new market for her magical portrait work while supporting a worthy charitable cause.
