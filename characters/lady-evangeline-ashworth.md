# Lady Evangeline Ashworth - Charitable Committee Chair

> *"Compassion without action is merely sentiment, dear. True charity requires both an open heart and a firm hand to ensure resources reach those who need them most."*

## Background

Lady Evangeline Ashworth has dedicated two decades to magical creature welfare as Chair of the Magical Creature Welfare Committee. Unlike her brother Reginald, who influences society through wealth and political connections, Evangeline takes a hands-on approach to philanthropy, regularly visiting the sanctuaries and reserves her committee supports.

Her committee oversees the distribution of charitable funds throughout magical Britain, with particular pride in their efficiencyâ€”less than five percent of donations go to administrative costs. The Ashworth family trust provides nearly twenty percent of the committee's annual budget, making their contributions vital to the welfare of countless magical creatures.

Augustus Thornwick's recent investigation into her committee's funding allocations has been both frustrating and insulting. After generations of Ashworth philanthropic service and her committee's spotless record, Evangeline finds the intense scrutiny excessive and worries that any suggestion of impropriety could damage both the committee's reputation and the welfare of creatures depending on their support.

## Gala Objectives

**1. Defend Committee's Reputation**
Speak with Ministry officials and fellow attendees to address any concerns about the magical creature welfare committee's financial practices. Evangeline needs to understand exactly what irregularities Augustus claimed to have found and reassure supporters that her committee maintains the highest standards of accountability.

**2. Secure Future Funding Commitments**
Use the gala as an opportunity to cultivate relationships with potential new donors who share her passion for magical creature welfare. With Augustus's investigation potentially affecting current funding sources, Evangeline must ensure the committee's financial stability to continue its vital work. Priority contacts include other prominent families and successful business owners who might be interested in supporting her cause.
