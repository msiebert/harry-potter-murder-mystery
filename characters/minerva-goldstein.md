# Minerva Goldstein - Diagon Alley Supply Chain Owner

> *"Business is like a well-orchestrated Quidditch match, my dear friends - you need the right players, perfect timing, and occasionally a well-placed Bludger to keep your competitors honest!"*

## Background

Minerva Goldstein has built one of Diagon Alley's most successful magical supply chain operations over the past fifteen years. A former Hufflepuff who believes in loyalty and hard work, she supplies rare potion ingredients and magical components to apothecaries, St. Mungo's, the Ministry, and even Hogwarts. Her efficient owl-post delivery service has earned her contracts throughout magical Britain.

Her business partnership with Madam Vivienne Roseheart began five years ago when Vivienne needed specialized magical threads for her enchanted fashion designs. Minerva provides magical components for Vivienne's garments while Vivienne designs her company uniforms and helps her navigate wealthy social circles. However, Vivienne has become increasingly controlling about their partnership, expecting advance notice for every business decision.

Last week's missed supplier meeting - which could have secured exclusive phoenix feather access - created serious tension between them. Vivienne suspected she was conducting secret business ventures, but the truth was far more embarrassing: Minerva was at Griffin's Gambit Hippogriff Racing having the gambling day of her life.

While Minerva enjoys occasional recreational gambling, she witnessed something deeply troubling during that visit. Fellow gambler Cornelius Pemberton suffered devastating losses, dropping at least 1,500 Galleons on three consecutive losing races. The man looked positively ill walking out of the track. Meanwhile, Minerva celebrated her own 800 Galleon win on Silverwing in the final race, making the contrast between their fortunes all the more stark.

## Gala Objectives

**1. Secure Healing Supplies Contract with Auror Commander Lysander Stone**
Approach the Auror Commander about securing a contract to supply healing potions and medical supplies for the Auror Office. With Aurors frequently suffering injuries in the line of duty, Minerva wants to discuss providing specialized healing ingredients and emergency medical supplies. This partnership could significantly grow her business while supporting those who protect the wizarding community.

**2. Explore New Business Opportunities**
Network with other successful entrepreneurs at the gala to identify potential new partnerships or supplier relationships. Minerva is particularly interested in connecting with Lady Alice Ashworth and Lavender Grimwald to explore mutually beneficial business relationships. She believes that diversifying her business relationships will both strengthen her supply chain and give her more independence in her partnership with Vivienne.
