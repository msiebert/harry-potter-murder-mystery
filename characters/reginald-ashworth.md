# Lord Reginald Ashworth - Pure-Blood Patriarch

> *"Tradition, my dear fellow, is not a chain that binds us—it's the very foundation upon which civilized wizarding society stands. Remove it, and we all come tumbling down."*

## Background

Lord Reginald Ashworth is the distinguished patriarch of one of wizarding Britain's oldest and most influential pure-blood families. As the keeper of centuries-old traditions and the guardian of his family's considerable fortune, Reginald has dedicated his life to preserving what he sees as the proper order of magical society. His sprawling estate, Ashworth Hall, houses one of the most extensive private collections of rare magical artifacts and ancient spellbooks outside of Hogwarts itself.

A shrewd businessman despite his aristocratic bearing, Reginald has built upon his inherited wealth through careful investments in established wizarding enterprises—from dragon reserves to premium wand-making workshops. He serves on the boards of several prestigious institutions and is known throughout the Ministry as both a generous donor and an uncompromising voice for "traditional values."

Though never one to dirty his hands with the day-to-day operations of government, Reginald wields considerable influence through his substantial financial contributions to Ministry programs. His donations have funded everything from Auror training facilities to the restoration of historic magical sites. However, he's become increasingly concerned about what he perceives as the Ministry's drift toward "progressive nonsense" under the current administration.

The late Augustus Thornwick had become a particular thorn in Reginald's side, pushing through reforms and investigations that seemed designed to undermine the very foundations of wizarding society. Reginald had made his displeasure known in several heated exchanges at Ministry functions.

## Gala Objectives

**1. Seek Political Reassurance**
Approach Minister Octavius Goldenheart to gauge his commitment to maintaining traditional Ministry policies and express concerns about recent progressive initiatives. Reginald needs to know whether the Minister can be counted on to resist further "radical" reforms.

**2. Evaluate Investment Opportunities**
Explore potential business ventures with fellow entrepreneurs at the gala, particularly those that align with Reginald's preference for established, traditional magical enterprises. Priority contacts include Sebastian Ravencrest, Barnabas Goldstein, and other successful business owners.
