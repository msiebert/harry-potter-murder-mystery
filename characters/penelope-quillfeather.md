# Madam Penelope Quillfeather - Head of Magical Accidents Department

> *"Progress in the wizarding world requires both wisdom and courage - qualities I've spent my career nurturing in the next generation of magical civil servants."*

## Background

Madam Penelope Quillfeather has dedicated over three decades to the Ministry of Magic, rising through the ranks with unwavering determination and an encyclopedic knowledge of magical mishaps. As Head of the Department for Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, she oversees everything from Accidental Magic Reversal to the Obliviator Headquarters, making her one of the most respected figures in magical emergency management.

Known throughout the Ministry for her sharp intellect and maternal approach to mentoring, Penelope has guided countless young wizards and witches through their early careers. Her most promising protégé was Augustus Thornwick, whom she personally recommended for rapid promotion after recognizing his exceptional investigative instincts and moral compass. She taught him everything she knew about uncovering the truth behind magical accidents - skills that proved invaluable when he began investigating corruption within their own ranks.

Currently, her department is investigating a troubling trend of delayed-action prank spells causing property damage throughout wizarding London. These explosion spells trigger exactly fifteen minutes after casting, making the perpetrators nearly impossible to catch. The precision timing suggests someone with advanced magical knowledge is teaching these dangerous techniques to younger pranksters.

## Gala Objectives

**1. Consult Professor Spellsworth about Delayed-Action Spells**
Seek the retired Headmaster's expertise regarding the recent property damage caused by explosion spells that trigger exactly 15 minutes after casting. His vast knowledge of advanced magical theory might help identify who could be teaching such dangerous techniques to pranksters.

**2. Network with Madam Isadora Nightingale for St. Mungo's Partnership**
Connect with the renowned Healer about potential collaboration opportunities between the Department for Magical Accidents and St. Mungo's new Spell Damage ward. Penelope believes her department's prevention protocols could complement the hospital's treatment innovations.
