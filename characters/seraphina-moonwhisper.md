# Seraphina Moonwhisper - Exclusive Catering Company Owner

> *"Darling, a perfectly catered event is like a beautifully brewed potion - every ingredient must be precisely measured, every timing flawlessly executed, and just a touch of magic to make it truly unforgettable."*

## Background

Seraphina Moonwhisper has built the most exclusive catering company in wizarding Britain, "Celestial Occasions," serving only the most prestigious magical society events. Her reputation for creating enchanted culinary experiences has made her the go-to caterer for Ministry galas, pure-blood family celebrations, and high-society charity functions. What sets Seraphina apart isn't just her exquisite magical cuisine, but her absolute discretion - in thirty years of catering for the wizarding elite, not a single scandal or private conversation has ever leaked from one of her events.

A former Hufflepuff who discovered her calling in the Hogwarts kitchens working alongside the house-elves, Seraphina learned that magical cooking requires not just skill with spells, but an intuitive understanding of how flavors, aromas, and presentation can create emotional experiences. She developed her signature techniques during a decade of travel through magical communities across Europe, learning ancient food preservation charms in Romania, flavor-enhancement spells in France, and the delicate art of color-changing beverages in Italy.

Her most important client relationship is with Lady Cordelia Blackthorne, who employs Seraphina's services exclusively for all her social events. This partnership, which began eight years ago, has been mutually beneficial - Cordelia's patronage provides Seraphina with access to the highest echelons of wizarding society, while Seraphina's impeccable service helps maintain Cordelia's reputation as the perfect hostess. Lady Cordelia often makes unusual requests for her events, but Seraphina has learned never to question her most valued client's specific instructions, no matter how peculiar they might seem.

Among Seraphina's most popular innovations is her collection of color-changing charms for beverages, which can transform any drink into beautiful shades of amber, crimson, emerald green, and sapphire blue. She's developed the incantation "Chromaticus Alterare" which creates these stunning visual transformations. As a signature marketing technique, Seraphina generously teaches this charm to high-end clients and potential customers, believing that when they use it at their own private gatherings, it serves as a beautiful reminder of her services and often leads to future bookings.

## Gala Objectives

**1. Expand Client Base with Ministry Officials**
With political uncertainty affecting some of her traditional pure-blood clients, Seraphina wants to cultivate relationships with influential Ministry officials who might need catering services for their own events. Priority contacts include Minister Octavius Goldenheart, Prudence Wickerham, and Madam Penelope Quillfeather.

**2. Find a Solution for Her Aging House-Elf**
Seraphina's beloved house-elf assistant, Pipkin, has been with her catering company for twenty years and is showing signs of magical exhaustion from decades of intensive cooking. The elderly elf's magic is becoming unreliable - last week his levitation charm dropped an entire tray of crystal glasses, and his temperature control spells have been inconsistent. Seraphina desperately needs advice on how to help Pipkin recover his magical strength or find gentle ways to transition his responsibilities without hurting his feelings. She's hoping someone at the gala might know about magical creature healing or have experience with similar situations.
