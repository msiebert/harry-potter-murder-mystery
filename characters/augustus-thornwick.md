# Augustus Thornwick - Deputy Minister (The Victim)

> *"Justice delayed is justice denied, and I refuse to let bureaucratic red tape stand in the way of what's right. The magical creatures of our world deserve better than empty promises and embezzled funds."*

## Background

Augustus Thornwick is a passionate and idealistic wizard who has rapidly risen through the Ministry ranks due to unwavering dedication to reform and justice. A crusading reformer who genuinely believes in changing the wizarding world for the better.

A former Ravenclaw prefect who graduated top of his class in Magical Law and Creature Studies, Augustus began his Ministry career in the lowly Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. However, his keen eye for detail and passionate advocacy for magical creature welfare quickly caught the attention of his superiors. Madam Penelope Quillfeather became his mentor, recognizing his potential and guiding his rapid ascent to Deputy Minister for Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.

Augustus has made his reputation as a crusading reformer, fearlessly investigating corruption wherever he finds it. His recent focus on the misappropriation of funds meant for magical creature welfare has ruffled many feathers in the upper echelons of wizarding society. He's discovered phantom transactions and missing Galleons that should have gone to improve conditions for house-elves, centaurs, and other magical beings.

## Recent Developments

Three weeks ago, Augustus noticed irregularities in the Ashworth family's charitable donations - specifically three phantom transactions totaling 15,000 Galleons that were supposedly allocated to magical creature welfare but never reached their intended destinations. He's been methodically building his case, knowing that exposing this corruption could shake the very foundations of the Ministry.

Recently, Augustus has become increasingly paranoid, telling Professor Spellsworth that he's been followed home from work and received anonymous threatening notes warning him to "drop the creature investigation or face consequences." Despite his fear, his moral conviction drives him forward - he plans to present his evidence to the Minister next week.

His former Hogwarts roommate Cornelius Pemberton has been helping him navigate the complex financial records, though Augustus doesn't yet realize that Cornelius is part of the very corruption scheme he's investigating.

## The Murder

During tonight's gala, Augustus will be found dead in the conservatory, apparently poisoned by a doctored glass of Firewhisky. However, magical examination will later reveal he died from a delayed-action curse that mimics poison - the work of someone who knew the dangerous Arresto Incantum spell that delays magical effects by exactly fifteen minutes.
