# Barnabas Goldstein - Diagon Alley Supply Chain Owner

> *"Business is like a well-orchestrated Quidditch match, my dear friends - you need the right players, perfect timing, and occasionally a well-placed Bludger to keep your competitors honest!"*

## Background

Barnabas Goldstein has built one of Diagon Alley's most successful magical supply chain operations over the past fifteen years. A former Hufflepuff who believes in loyalty and hard work, he supplies rare potion ingredients and magical components to apothecaries, St. Mungo's, the Ministry, and even Hogwarts. His efficient owl-post delivery service has earned him contracts throughout magical Britain.

His business partnership with Madam Vivienne Roseheart began five years ago when she needed specialized magical threads for her enchanted fashion designs. Barnabas provides magical components for her garments while she designs his company uniforms and helps him navigate wealthy social circles. However, Vivienne has become increasingly controlling about their partnership, expecting advance notice for every business decision.

Last week's missed supplier meeting - which could have secured exclusive phoenix feather access - created serious tension between them. Vivienne suspected he was conducting secret business ventures, but the truth was far more embarrassing: Barnabas was at Griffin's Gambit Hippogriff Racing having the gambling day of his life.

While Barnabas enjoys occasional recreational gambling, he witnessed something deeply troubling during that visit. Fellow gambler Cornelius Pemberton suffered devastating losses, dropping at least 1,500 Galleons on three consecutive losing races. The man looked positively ill walking out of the track. Meanwhile, Barnabas celebrated his own 800 Galleon win on Silverwing in the final race, making the contrast between their fortunes all the more stark.

## Gala Objectives

**1. Secure St. Mungo's Contract Expansion with Madam Isadora Nightingale**
As a renowned St. Mungo's Healer attending the gala, Isadora could be instrumental in helping Barnabas expand his medical supply contracts. He wants to discuss providing specialized ingredients for the new Spell Damage ward and potentially securing exclusive supplier status for experimental healing potions. This partnership could significantly grow his business while supporting vital magical medical research.

**2. Explore New Business Opportunities**
Network with other successful entrepreneurs at the gala to identify potential new partnerships or supplier relationships. Barnabas is particularly interested in connecting with Lord Reginald Ashworth, Sebastian Ravencrest, and Tobias Grimwald to explore mutually beneficial business relationships. He believes that diversifying his business relationships will both strengthen his supply chain and give him more independence in his partnership with Vivienne.
