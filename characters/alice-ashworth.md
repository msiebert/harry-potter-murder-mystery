# Lady Alice Ashworth - Pure-Blood Matriarch

> *"Tradition, my dear fellow, is not a chain that binds us—it's the very foundation upon which civilized wizarding society stands. Remove it, and we all come tumbling down."*

## Background

Lady Alice Ashworth is the distinguished matriarch of one of wizarding Britain's oldest and most influential pure-blood families. As the keeper of centuries-old traditions and the guardian of her family's considerable fortune, Alice has dedicated her life to preserving what she sees as the proper order of magical society. Her sprawling estate, Ashworth Hall, houses one of the most extensive private collections of rare magical artifacts and ancient spellbooks outside of Hogwarts itself.

A shrewd businesswoman despite her aristocratic bearing, Alice has built upon her inherited wealth through careful investments in established wizarding enterprises—from dragon reserves to premium wand-making workshops. She serves on the boards of several prestigious institutions and is known throughout the Ministry as both a generous donor and an uncompromising voice for "traditional values."

Though never one to dirty her hands with the day-to-day operations of government, Alice wields considerable influence through her substantial financial contributions to Ministry programs. Her donations have funded everything from Auror training facilities to the restoration of historic magical sites. However, she's become increasingly concerned about what she perceives as the Ministry's drift toward "progressive nonsense" under the current administration.

The late Augustus Thornwick had become a particular thorn in Alice's side, pushing through reforms and investigations that seemed designed to undermine the very foundations of wizarding society. Alice had made her displeasure known in several heated exchanges at Ministry functions.

## Gala Objectives

**1. Seek Political Reassurance**
Approach Minister Octavius Goldenheart to gauge his commitment to maintaining traditional Ministry policies and express concerns about recent progressive initiatives. Alice needs to know whether the Minister can be counted on to resist further "radical" reforms.

**2. Evaluate Investment Opportunities**
Explore potential business ventures with fellow entrepreneurs at the gala, particularly those that align with Alice's preference for established, traditional magical enterprises. Priority contacts include Lavender Grimwald, Minerva Goldstein, and other successful business owners.
