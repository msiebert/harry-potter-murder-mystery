## Solution

### The Murderer and Accomplices
**Cornelius Pemberton** (Senior Ministry Treasurer), **Lady Cordelia Blackthorne** (Wealthy Socialite), and **Nigel Crimplebottom** (Ministry Accountant) worked together to eliminate Augustus before he could expose their crimes.

### The Method
This was a sophisticated two-part murder designed to create the perfect alibi:

**Cornelius's Role:** Cast the Arresto Incantum spell (15-minute delay charm) followed immediately by Cordis Cessare (heart attack curse). The delay allowed him to be far from Augustus and engaged in visible conversation when the curse took effect.

**Lady Cordelia's Role:** Applied a delayed color-changing charm to Augustus's Firewhisky, timed to turn red 15 minutes later - exactly when the heart attack curse activated. This created the false appearance that Augustus was poisoned, misdirecting the initial investigation.

**Nigel's Role:** Worked to confuse guests so they wouldn't guess Cornelius's crime

### The Motive
**Embezzlement Cover-Up:** For five years, Cornelius and Cordelia operated a criminal partnership, with Nigel Crimplebottom as their inside accomplice. Cornelius skimmed money from magical creature welfare funds to cover his devastating gambling debts, while his subordinate Nigel cooked the books to hide the theft. Cordelia provided untraceable Galleons from her illegal magical creature trafficking operation in exchange for Ministry favors. When Augustus's investigation threatened to expose the missing 15,000+ Galleons, all three conspirators faced Azkaban unless Augustus was silenced.

### Key Evidence Trail
- Augustus's notes show he trusted "C.P." (Cornelius Pemberton) to help with the investigation
- Gambling evidence points to financial desperation
- Only five people knew the Arresto Incantum spell: Augustus, Lavender, Cornelius, Cordelia, and Sebastian
- The embezzlement note reveals someone stealing from creature welfare funds to cover gambling losses
- The audit announcement created urgent pressure to act before discovery
