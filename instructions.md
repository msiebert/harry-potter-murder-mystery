## How to Use Your Character Backstory

Your character backstory provides everything you need to authentically portray your role throughout the evening. Here's how to make the most of it:

### **Your Backstory**
Explains your character's history, profession, and relationships

### **Your Gala Objectives**
Each character has **two specific objectives** for the evening - these are your character's personal goals and the information they're seeking from other attendees:

**üé≠ Immersion Objectives**: Some objectives are purely for roleplay fun - networking for business opportunities, seeking advice about personal challenges, or reconnecting with old classmates. These help create authentic conversations and deepen the magical atmosphere.

**üîç Mystery-Relevant Objectives**: Other objectives will naturally lead you toward information crucial to solving the evening's central mystery. These conversations may reveal important clues, suspicious behavior, or contradictory stories.
