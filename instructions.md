### **Your Backstory**
- **Background & Personality**: Explains your character's history, profession, and relationships
- **Hogwarts Connection**: Every character is a Hogwarts alumnus with specific House affiliations, favorite subjects, and school memories that shaped who they became

### **Your Gala Objectives**
Each character has **two specific objectives** for the evening - these are your character's personal goals and the information they're seeking from other attendees:
